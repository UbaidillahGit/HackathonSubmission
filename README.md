GrabHealthEats

## Overview
Our project, GrabHealthEats, represents the future of GrabFoodâ€”designed to meet your nutritional and health needs. 
By leveraging Generative AI, we offer users the ability to select food options tailored to their specific dietary preferences and health concerns, such as vegan diets, halal food, allergies, and chronic conditions like hypertension.
In Indonesia, hypertension silently affects 34.1% of the population. 
GrabHealthEats addresses this by prioritizing safe and personalized food choices that not only adhere to dietary restrictions but also support the management of chronic conditions, offering a healthier and more personalized dining experience.
